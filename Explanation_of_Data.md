Recap of usefull information to understand the different datasets present in the folder:
    - Folders rd1 to rd4 represent the four rounds of de-novo of experiemntal design(iterative, data-driven protein design) following this new massively parallel apprach. Each round is comprised of three basic steps: backbone contruction following standard approches in the literature, sequence design(in which many sequences are created and then evaluated based on some metrics, these sequences are generally generated trough Rosetta), then these designed sequences(which he refers to as designs) are evaluated with metrics inside and outside Rosetta. The de-novo protein design is to be considered as the overall four rounds of procedure, hence as we increase in the the rounds counter we are getting better and better designs(look at paper for quantification)
    - Folder ssm2_stability scores: this folders represents a different experiment from the one 
    of rd1-rd4 from my understading, and in the paper wants to assess the sequence determinants of stability. It is referred to as the saturation Mutagenesis Library. Hence they study point mutations of 14 designs and 3 known proteins. 
    RK: designs are proteins of a given topology.

The plots on the paper measure the correlation between the loglikelihoods of the potts models and the stability scores of the ssm2 dataset, not of the others!!!! This makes sense because the proteins in the other experiments are different proteins from one another is a broader sense, hence the in no reason to think that a signle Potts model should correlate acrooss these proteins.
